# Machine Learning Algorithms - From Scratch
Overview:
   - This project includes manual implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms alongside their scikit-learn versions for comparison.
   - Each algorithm is structured in its own directory with a README, preprocessing steps, and source code.

Included Algorithms:
   1. Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
      - Implemented from scratch using NumPy.
      - Compared against scikit-learn’s GaussianNB.
      - Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin.
   2. Logistic Regression
      - Manual implementation using batch gradient descent.
      - Compared against scikit-learn’s LogisticRegression.
      - Dataset: Telco Customer Churn.

Notes:
   - Each folder includes:
      - Data Preprocessing steps (in a separate file).
      - Manual implementation notebook.
      - scikit-learn implementation notebook.
      - Individual README summarizing problem, data, methods, and results.
